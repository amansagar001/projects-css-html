          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India</b> in 2002
            with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
            then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
            "People's President" he returned to his civilian life of education,
            writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian
            Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands,
            including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony
            held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full
            state honours.
